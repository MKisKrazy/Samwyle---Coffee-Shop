Your UI has a clean, minimalistic coffee shop design, and structuring it properly in your React + Tailwind CSS project will help with maintainability and reusability.  

---

 ðŸ“Œ Project Structure Suggestion
Hereâ€™s how you can break it into components, pages, and layout:

 1. Pages (`/pages/`)
These represent full pages in your app:
- `Home.jsx` â†’ This is your main coffee shop landing page.
- `Shop.jsx` â†’ If you have a separate shop section.
- `Promotions.jsx` â†’ If there are deals or special offers.
- `Contact.jsx` â†’ A page for contact details.

---

 2. Components (`/components/`)
Reusable UI elements:
- `Navbar.jsx` â†’ The navigation bar (logo, links, "Contact Us" button).
- `HeroSection.jsx` â†’ The intro section with the heading "Coffee Shop" and "Order Here" button.
- `FeatureCard.jsx` â†’ Used for sections like "Coffee of the Day".
- `ProductCard.jsx` â†’ Used for Americano, Latte, Espresso cards.
- `Footer.jsx` â†’ Bottom section with the map and address.
- `SocialLinks.jsx` â†’ Side floating social media icons.
- `Button.jsx` â†’ Common button component (`Order Now`).

---

 3. Layout (`/layout/`)
- `MainLayout.jsx` â†’ Wraps all pages with `<Navbar />` and `<Footer />`.

 ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Start with `MainLayout.jsx` to structure the overall layout.
- Build `Navbar` and `Footer` first since they appear on all pages.
- Use Tailwind for styling (with utility classes for spacing & layout).
- Use props to make `FeatureCard` and `ProductCard` reusable.

This setup will keep your project modular, reusable, and easy to scale!
